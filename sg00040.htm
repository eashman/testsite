<P>
The inside of the mouth is normally lined with a special type of skin (mucosa) that is smooth and coral pink in color. Any alteration in this appearance could be a warning sign of a number of possible disease processes. The most serious of these is oral
cancer. The following may  be signs of the beginning of a disease process or cancerous growth:
<P>
*Red patches (erythroplasia)
<P>
*White patches (leukoplakia)
<P>
*A sore that fails to heal and/or bleeds easily
<P>
*A lump or thickening on the skin lining the inside of the mouth
<P>
*A chronic sore throat and/or hoarseness
<P>
*Difficulty in chewing or swallowing
<P>
These signs and symptoms may be located on the lips, cheeks, palate, gum tissue around the teeth, tongue, face, and/or neck. Pain is not always present. However, any facial and/or oral pain without an obvious cause or reason may also be at sign of
disease.
<P>
It is recommend that patients perform an oral cancer self-examination monthly. If you are at a high risk for oral cancer - a smoker, a drinker or user of smokeless tobacco - you should also see your dentist or an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for an
exam yearly.  Your dentist or this office can provide you with information on this subject.  Do not ignore suspicious lumps or sores. Please contact your dentist, your physician or this office if you or discover a suspicious area or have any concerns or
questions.
