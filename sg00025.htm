<H3><A NAME=sg00026>What is an Impacted tooth?</A></H3>
Although any of the adult or baby teeth may become impacted, the most common impacted tooth is the upper and lower third molar teeth also known as the wisdom teeth.  There are usually four wisdom teeth, one on the upper and lower on each side of the
mouth. They are the teeth farthest back in the mouth which means they may also be the most difficult to clean even if they erupt into the proper position!  Wisdom teeth begin to form and develop in the jaw bone at nine years of age.  By approximately age
sixteen the jaws have reached their adult size. The jaw size determines whether there will be enough room for the wisdom teeth to erupt into the mouth normally. If there is not enough room for the wisdom teeth to come in, they will remain trapped in the
jaw bone. When this happens the wisdom teeth are said to be impacted. Impacted teeth can take many positions in the bone as they attempt to find a pathway that will allow them to erupt successfully. Sometimes part of the wisdom tooth shows in the mouth.
This tooth is still impacted, as part of the biting surface of the tooth is covered by bone and/or gum tissue.
<BR><H3><A NAME=sg00027>What Problems Can Be Caused By Impacted Wisdom Teeth?</A></H3>
The most common complaint associated with impacted wisdom teeth is pain.  A patient may may have soreness or pain in the back part of the jaw, ear ache, sore throat or pain in the side of the face.  The impacted wisdom tooth itself may be the source of
the pain or there may be an infection associated it. Food and debri containing destructive bacteria may become trapped between the gum tissue and the underlying wisdom tooth causing a painful infection around the crown of the wisdom tooth even though you
don't see the tooth. People may mistake repeated soreness of the gum tissue overlying the wisdom teeth as an effort by the teeth to erupt. Usually this is a warning sign potential infection. If untreated by removing the wisdom tooth, the infection may
cause destruction of the bone surrounding the wisdom tooth and may affect the neighboring tooth.  The same types of bacteria that are responsible for infections can also cause tooth decay or cavities in the impacted wisdom tooth and the root of the
adjacent tooth.  Just the constant pressure from the impacted wisdom tooth can also lead to destruction of the tooth next to it. Although the overall occurrence of cysts and tumors associated with the jaws is low, when they do occur it is most frequently
around an impacted wisdom tooth. Your orthodontist may request that wisdom teeth be removal prior to braces as they may interfere with straightening the other teeth.
<BR><H3><A NAME=sg00028>When Should Wisdom Teeth Be Removed?</A></H3>
When it is obvious that the wisdom teeth will become impacted, they should be removed. This decision can be made by the time the patient is sixteen or seventeen years of age. Removal of impacted wisdom teeth in this age group has distinct advantages. At
this age the roots are seldom fully formed, even though the tooth has become impacted. Removing an impacted wisdom tooth before the roots are fully formed is usually less traumatic for the patient. Typically, patient's having impacted wisdom teeth
removed in their mid-teens have a more rapid recovery and have a shorter and less complicated post opertive course.

<BR><H3><A NAME=sg00029>How Are Impacted Wisdom Teeth Removed?</A></H3>
Most patients have their wisdom removed in the oral surgeon's office. Improvements in surgical technique and sedative medications allow patients to have their impacted wisdom teeth removed comfortably and efficiently in a pleasant environment at a cost
far less than the hospital setting.
<P>
There are several anesthetic options available to optimize comfort during their surgery and minimize the postoperative side effects. These options will be discussed with you during your consultation with Dr. Ashman.  He will also address your individual
needs and concerns.
<P>
If you have other questions regarding this condition, wish to consult further with Dr. Ashman or are in need of a second opinion, please do not hesitate to call and arrange a consultation appointment.
