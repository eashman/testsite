<h3><a NAME="sg00032">What Is An Implant?</a></h3>

<p>In Medicine, the term implant refers to a device that replaces a body part which is
missing. These devices or implants are surgically put or implanted into the body and
function instead of the body part that it is replacing. An example of a medical implant is
the use of an artificial knee joint to replace a painful, worn-out arthritic knee. </p>

<p>Implants are constructed from materials that are compatible with the tissues of the
body; therefore the body does not reject them. A dental implant is a device that is used
to replace the root portion of a missing tooth or missing teeth. Dental implants are used
to support natural looking teeth and enable patients who are missing some or all of their
natural teeth to smile, speak with confidence and chew their food more comfortably. </p>

<p>The most common type of dental implant that is placed into the jaw bone is the threaded
titanium cylinder. Dental implants are also available as non-threaded, non-tapered
cylinders and as non-threaded, tapered cylinders. The type of implant used is decided upon
by the surgeon and depends on the location in the jaw that the implant is needed, and the
forces that the implant will encounter. <br>
</p>

<h3><a NAME="sg00033">Am I A Candidate For Dental Implants?</a></h3>

<p>If you are missing one or more teeth, or even a part of the jaw bone, then you may be a
candidate for dental implants. It has been estimated that approximately 125 million
Americans are missing one or more teeth for one reason or another! </p>

<p>A candidate for dental implants should be in a good state of health. You should inform
your surgeon of any systemic illnesses or conditions that may adversely affect healing.
Conditions such as diabetes may not prevent you from having dental implant surgery
provided that the disease is being treated successfully. Any concerns that you may have
regarding your medical history should be discussed with your surgeon at the consultation
appointment. </p>

<p>A candidate for dental implants should have enough high quality bone to support the
implant(s). When a tooth is lost, the surrounding bone begins to change and may slowly
disappear. This slow process is called resorption. If the amount of resorption is slight,
then a dental implant may be placed into the bone. However, if the amount of resorption is
too great, there may be insufficient bone available to support the implant and bone
grafting may be required prior to implant surgery. At the consultation appointment, a
complete examination will be performed and you will be informed of the condition of your
bone and the options you have with regard to dental implants. <br>
</p>

<h3><a NAME="sg00034">How Are Implants Placed?</a></h3>

<p>Surgical placement of dental implants is a two-stage procedure. The first stage
involves creating a channel within the bone which is slightly smaller than the dental
implant. The implant is placed into that channel by means of the threads on threaded
implants or with gentle tapping in the case of non-threaded implants. The small wound over
the implant is sutured. The bone is allowed to heal around the implant for 4 to 6 months.
You may be allowed to wear temporary bridges and dentures during the healing stage. </p>

<p>The second stage of the procedure is performed 4 to 6 months after the first surgery. A
small opening is made over the implant and a metal post is attached to the implant through
the gum tissue. After a short healing period (2 to 4 weeks), the patient's restorative
dentist will make the appropriate crown, bridge or denture type restoration using the
support of the implant or implants that have been placed into the bone. </p>

<p>These procedures may be performed under local anesthesia, intravenous sedation or
general anesthesia depending on how you wish to proceed. Your surgeon will explain your
options at the consultation appointment. <br>
</p>

<h3><a NAME="sg00035">Are Implants Successful?</a></h3>

<p>Most patients can expect their implants to remain in function for many years. The
individual success rate for an implant is determined by a number of factors including the
patient's health, the amount of bone available, quality of the bone available, the type of
restoration and the patient's oral hygiene and maintenance program. </p>

<p>Occasionally a problems may arise and a small percentage of implants must be removed.
If a dental implant is removed it can often be replaced when the bone in the area has
healed. Implants have proven to be a reliable treatment alternative for patients with
missing teeth. <br>

<p>&quot;Dental Implants - Should you bite?&quot; (July, 1996) </p>

<p><b><u>INTRODUCTION</u></b> </p>

<p>About 19 million American adults have no teeth; another 113 million are missing at
least one tooth. Many of those gaps are filled with dentures and bridges. But if you wear
such an appliance, you're probably familiar with the limitations - they can weaken your
bite, cause discomfort, and even harm the adjacent teeth. </p>

<p>Many people are turning to dental implants - artificial teeth surgically anchored into
the jawbone and intended to be a better-looking replacement. Ads promote implants as
&quot;the next best thing to natural teeth.&quot; Perhaps 400,000 individual implants are
now done each year. </p>

<p>But they're a major investment and not risk-free. If you need extensive work, you could
wind up paying tens of thousands of dollars, spending lots of time in dentists' chairs,
and waiting more than a year for your new &quot;teeth.&quot; You'll also need to be an
unusually assertive patient, checking out the credentials of the dentists and the implants
they use. Some dentists who do implants have insufficient training, and some implant
materials have been in-sufficiently studied. </p>

<p>Are implants worth all this? Their track record suggests they are, for some people -
but because of their cost and possible complications, you should try other approaches
first. </p>

<p><u><b>OLD, CHEAPER CHOICES</b></u> </p>

<p>Standard dentures and bridges have a lot going for them. You can get them fitted in a
matter of weeks, the bill won't exceed a few thousand dollars, and dental insurance
usually will pay part of the cost. But they do have their drawbacks. </p>

<p>Removable dentures can be hard to eat with because they provide only a fraction of the
chewing force of natural teeth. A full lower denture can be especially troublesome; jaw
and tongue movements may easily dislodge it. Ill-fitting dentures can be bulky and painful
- hard plastic riding atop a thin layer of gum tissue over bone. Partial dentures, which
replace a few missing teeth, can also promote tooth decay around their clasps and, by
mechanical action, weaken the adjacent teeth. </p>

<p>For people missing just one or a few teeth, a fixed bridge looks and feels more like
the real thing and provides near-normal chewing force. It's cemented in place over the
natural teeth abutting the gap. But those end teeth first must be ground to stubs, to
accommodate caps. Bridges can also weaken other teeth: a fixed bridge that spans too wide
a gap can loosen the teeth it's cemented to. </p>

<p><u><b>HOW IMPLANTS COMPARE</b></u> </p>

<p>Implants generally look and feel more natural than removable bridges; they provide
about the same amount of biting force as fixed bridges but are kinder to neighboring
teeth. Although other mechanisms have been used, the implants now typically rely on
titanium fixtures inserted into the jawbone during surgery. </p>

<p>The process of drilling holes, inserting fixtures, and attaching teeth can be daunting.
For a full set of teeth, four to six fixtures are needed in the lower jaw, and six to
eight in the upper, where bone is less dense. Patients wear temporary bridges while the
bone heals, which takes three months for the lower jaw and six for the upper. Then it can
take three or more months to take impressions, fashion individual teeth or multi-tooth
segments, and attach them to the fixtures. </p>

<p>The replacement teeth can take some time to get just right; the bite needs to be well
adjusted to distribute pressure evenly. </p>

<p>Each fixture can cost $800 to $2500; each crown, $600 to $1500. While the total cost
for a single-tooth implant - $1500 to $4000 - isn't much more than that for a small fixed
bridge, costs quickly rise from there. A full upper or lower jaw can cost as much as
$18,000 to $30,000 - 10 to 15 times as much as a full denture. </p>

<p>For people who need complete dentures, a slightly less expensive option (around
$10,000) is a removable &quot;overdenture&quot; that attaches to two or four posts. </p>

<p>How permanent are these new teeth? No one knows for sure, since the earliest implants
are just 30 years old. Most failures appear to occur early on, if a fixture fails to
integrate with the bone, or if it comes loose. An implant's reliability seems to be
influenced by its location; the survival rate after five years is about 95 percent for
implants in the front of the lower jaw but about 85 percent for implants in the sides and
rear of the upper jaw. In a very few patients, implants fail completely. Dentists usually
can replace loose fixtures by letting bone refill the socket and drilling again in a few
months. </p>

<p>One reason implants fail is poor oral hygiene. You'll need to floss and brush
assiduously, into the openings and around fixtures, using special brushes. You'll also
need to be seen by your dentist as often as four times a year. </p>

<p><u><b>THE OPERATION</b></u> </p>

<p>Being fitted with implants is not a minor procedure. Here are two key factors to
consider: </p>

<p>Are you a good candidate? Certain drugs and diseases that compromise healing - steroids
or uncontrolled diabetes, for instance - can lessen your chances of a good result. Smokers
and heavy drinkers may not get good results, either. </p>

<p>Moreover, you must have enough bone for the fixtures to hold. Otherwise, you may be
headed down an expensive detour: thousands of dollars (and an extra nine months) for bone
grafts. Finally, since your gums won't cling to artificial teeth as tightly as to normal
teeth, some dentists recommend additional surgery to make your gum line look more natural.
</p>

<p>Which dentists? Some dentists operate after taking only a weekend course. Avoid them.
It's best to be treated by an experienced pair of specialists, one to operate and the
other (a prosthodontist or general dentist) to craft your new teeth. Look for a team that
has done at least 50 cases overall and 10 to 15 like yours. Ask to speak with some other
patients. The surgery should be done by an oral surgeon, periodontist, or prosthodontist -
or a general dentist with extra credentials such as those issued by the American Academy
of Implant Dentistry (for a list, call the Academy at 312 335-1550). </p>

<p>Ask any potential surgeon whether the hardware he or she uses has been accepted by the
American Dental Association. To gain ADA acceptance, manufacturers must conduct two
five-year clinical studies to show the hardware holds up in real use. Most implant systems
don't have ADA acceptance. </p>

<p><b><u>RECOMMENDATIONS</u></b> </p>

<p>Implants might make sense if you have dentures and can't adjust to them, or if you want
to fill gaps without harming adjacent teeth - and if you have the money. </p>

<p>Still, it is not a decision to make lightly. Weigh not only your wallet but also your
willingness to seek out a reliable practitioner, to put up with months of procedures and
temporary teeth, to be scrupulous about hygiene, and to accept the small chance that the
effort may fail and you'll end up with dentures anyway. </p>
